# Presentation Upgrade Plan — Tracker

**Progress: 34 / 146 presentations complete**

Every Reveal.js deck in this repo is being rebuilt to the same "feature rich and
engaging" standard set by
[`inside-the-pc-components-ocn-level2-presentation.html`](inside-the-pc-components-ocn-level2-presentation.html)
(deck #94) — 33 slides, seven interactive features, speaker notes throughout.

This file is the shared worklist. Each agent claims decks, upgrades them, and
ticks the boxes in [section 7](#7-deck-checklist).

## 1. Definition of done

A deck is only ticked when **all** of the following are true.

**Scale**

- 26–34 slides. Small-tier decks grow the most, large-tier decks the least.

**Interactivity**

- 3–5 topic-specific interactive widgets from [the library](#3-interactive-widget-library),
  chosen because they fit the topic — not bolted on because they were easy to copy.
- At least one must be a *doing* widget (build, sort, simulate, calculate), not
  just a click-to-reveal.
- A 6-question scored quiz with progress pill, score bar, a results slide with a
  letter grade, and a retry button. This replaces the 3-question click quiz that
  every deck currently ships with.

**Content depth**

- A real-world case study — a named incident, business, or concrete classroom scenario.
- A common-faults table: symptom → likely cause → fix.
- A searchable jargon buster with 10–20 terms.
- A cross-deck pathway map linking 4–6 sibling decks in this library.
- An extended practical task with success criteria and an evidence checklist.

**Delivery**

- `<aside class="notes">` on **every** slide, each with a delivery cue and a
  timing estimate. The notes should add up to a coherent 60–90 minute lesson.

**Chrome and branding**

- `.back-to-index` link, `.site-credit` footer, `#circuit-canvas` particle
  background with `data-canvas-bg` on the title and closing slides.
- `.demo-meta` badge on the title slide matching the deck number and level shown
  on its `index.html` card.
- No changes to the brand palette (`--brand-orange`, `--brand-purple`, `--brand-teal`).

**Accessibility and robustness**

- Every widget operable by keyboard (Enter/Space) as well as pointer.
- Touch fallback (tap-to-select, tap-to-place) for anything drag-based.
- `aria-label` on controls, `aria-live="polite"` on score readouts,
  `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative icons and canvases.
- `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` honoured by every animation.
- Layout survives `@media (max-width: 768px)`.

**Verification**

- No console errors on load or while using any widget.
- Quiz scores correctly and the results grade matches the score.
- Renders correctly at the 1920×1080 authoring size and at mobile width.
- Speaker view (**S**) shows the notes.

**Index**

- The deck's card in `index.html` has `data-updated` bumped to the upgrade date
  (this drives the "Recently added" widget), `data-upgraded="true"` (this drives
  the index **Upgraded** filter), and its `<p>` blurb refreshed if the scope
  changed.

## 2. Canonical slide blueprint

Follow this skeleton and drop topic content into it. Bracketed counts show where
a deck can flex.

| # | Slide |
|---|---|
| 1 | Title — `data-canvas-bg`, animated gradient heading, `.demo-meta` badge, qualification pill |
| 2 | Learning objectives — fragments with `fade-up` |
| 3 | How to use this deck — keyboard hints, "interactives are clickable and tappable" |
| 4 | Why this matters — hook, stats bar, a real consequence |
| 5–7 | Core concept slides — feature grid, comparison boxes, diagrams [3–5] |
| 8 | **Signature interactive #1** — the deck's headline widget |
| 9–11 | Applied detail — how it works in practice, step sequence, worked example [2–4] |
| 12 | **Signature interactive #2** |
| 13 | Real-world case study |
| 14 | Common faults — symptom → cause → fix table |
| 15 | **Signature interactive #3** — game or challenge, ideally timed with a `localStorage` best score |
| 16 | Practical task — brief, success criteria, evidence checklist |
| 17 | Jargon buster — searchable glossary |
| 18 | Where this fits — cross-deck pathway map |
| 19 | Quiz intro with score bar |
| 20–25 | Quiz Q1–Q6 |
| 26 | Results — grade and retry |
| 27 | Key takeaways — 4 pillars |
| 28 | Career pathways — roles, skills, stats bar |
| 29 | Next steps and further reading |
| 30 | Thank you — `data-canvas-bg` |

## 3. Interactive widget library

### 3.1 Copy directly from the reference deck

All line numbers refer to
[`inside-the-pc-components-ocn-level2-presentation.html`](inside-the-pc-components-ocn-level2-presentation.html).

| Widget | What the learner does | CSS | JS |
|---|---|---|---|
| Flip cards | Click or press Enter/Space to reveal the back of a card | 637–687 | `initFlipCards()` 1890–1900 |
| SVG hotspot explorer | Click numbered hotspots on an inline SVG; info panel updates. Quiz mode hides the answer for 1.5s first | 689–751 | `initMotherboard()` + `MB_INFO` 1878–1942 |
| Drag-and-drop sort | Drag shuffled chips into labelled bins; wrong answers shake. Tap-to-select touch fallback | 753–854 | `createChips()`, `initDnD()`, `handleDrop()` 1945–2078 |
| Timed challenge | 60s countdown over a DnD board, warning state at 10s, best time kept in `localStorage` | 843–854 | `startTimer()`, `stopTimer()` 2080–2109 |
| Scored quiz | `data-quiz="N"` sections, `.quiz-option[data-correct]`, progress pill, letter grade | 856–904 | `initQuiz()`, `updateQuizUI()`, `showResults()` 2126–2192 |
| Searchable glossary | Type to filter `.glossary-item` entries by their `data-terms` | 906–939 | `initGlossary()` 2112–2123 |
| Particle canvas | Ambient background that only paints on `data-canvas-bg` slides | 1136–1143 | `initCanvas()` 2195–2253 |

### 3.2 New widgets to build

Write these once for the deck you need them in, then reuse the pattern
elsewhere. Keep them in the same house style.

- **Step simulator** — Next/Back through a process with the current state
  highlighted on a diagram. Good for DORA, DNS resolution, boot sequence, OS
  install stages, incident response phases.
- **Rule / packet evaluator** — the learner edits a small rule table, fires test
  inputs, and sees allow/deny with the matching rule highlighted. Good for
  firewalls, validation rules, file permissions.
- **Live calculator** — sliders or inputs feeding a computed result with a bar or
  gauge. Good for time-to-crack, cost-per-GB, kWh to cost and CO₂, PSU wattage,
  effective permissions, SLA clocks.
- **Before/after slider** — drag a divider between a messy and a fixed state.
  Good for bad vs good CV, unrefactored vs refactored code, dirty vs clean data.
- **Decision tree** — branching yes/no cards ending in a verdict with a rationale.
  Good for troubleshooting, "I found a USB stick", printer faults.
- **Scenario judge** — show a scenario card, learner votes, reveal with feedback
  and a running score. Good for GDPR verdicts, safe-or-scam, correlation vs causation.
- **Sequence builder** — drag steps into the correct order, validate, and show the
  first wrong position. Good for crimping, build order, deployment pipelines, git workflow.
- **Terminal / log replay** — typed-out fake console output with a filter or search
  box over canned data. Good for `nslookup`, `nmap`, unit test output, event logs.
- **Mini sandbox** — a genuinely live tool where it is safe and works offline:
  HTML/CSS preview in an iframe, Caesar cipher tool, validation tester,
  hash-and-chain blockchain demo, contrast checker.
- **Card sort / matcher** — match term to definition, or threat to defence, with a
  scored check.
- **Myth buster** — a claim card flips to an evidence-backed verdict.
- **Design canvas** — drag devices or components onto a plan area against a budget
  or rule set. Good for small-office networks, smart homes, IoT rooms.

### 3.3 House rules for new code

- Hold state in a single `AppState` object at the top of the script block.
- Guard every listener with `if (el.dataset.bound) return; el.dataset.bound = 'true';`
- Initialise on `Reveal.on('ready')` and re-initialise on `Reveal.on('slidechanged')`.
- Everything stays inline in the single HTML file. No build step, no new
  dependencies beyond the Reveal.js / Font Awesome / Google Fonts CDNs already in use.
- Never rename a deck file — `index.html` links are hand-maintained.

## 4. Tier recipes

**Small tier — 14–17 slides, ~370–500 lines → 26–30 slides**

The biggest lift. These decks are missing the shared chrome as well as content.

1. Port the full CSS block from a medium-tier deck (e.g. `dns-in-action`), which
   brings `.back-to-index` and `.site-credit` with it.
2. Add the particle canvas and `data-canvas-bg` on title/closing.
3. Add roughly 12 slides: why-it-matters, two concept slides, three widgets, case
   study, faults table, glossary, pathway map, three extra quiz questions, results.
4. Add speaker notes to every slide, old and new.

**Medium tier — 15–17 slides, ~820–940 lines → 28–32 slides**

Chrome is already there; the content skeleton is generic.

1. Replace the "Demo Sequence" slide with a step simulator.
2. Replace the "Symptom Guide" slide with an interactive faults table or decision tree.
3. Add case study, glossary, pathway map, and two more widgets.
4. Expand the quiz to six questions plus results.
5. Add speaker notes throughout.

**Large tier — 17–23 slides, ~970–1180 lines → 30–34 slides**

Content is already strong; interactivity is not.

1. Convert existing static comparison and diagram slides into widgets in place.
2. Add two or three new widgets, glossary, and pathway map.
3. Expand the quiz to six questions plus results.
4. Add speaker notes throughout.

**Special cases**

- **#142 Network Diagram** is a bare 52-line Mermaid page, not a deck. Build it
  out into a full presentation: keep a topology diagram as the centrepiece and add
  a drag-to-build classroom LAN, cabling notes, and an IP plan.
- **#143 VEXcode Tutorial** is a scroll page on the VEX brand, not a Reveal deck.
  Keep the scroll format and the VEX palette. Add a sticky progress rail,
  per-section checkpoint questions, copy-code buttons, and a block-assembly
  interactive.

---

## 5. Agent workflow

1. **Claim first.** Change `- [ ]` to `- [~]` and append your branch name for the
   decks you are taking, then commit *that change on its own* before doing the
   work. This stops parallel agents colliding.
2. **Branch.** `cursor/upgrade-<topic>-<suffix>`. Take 3–6 decks per branch and PR.
3. **Upgrade** each deck against [section 1](#1-definition-of-done).
4. **Update `index.html`** — bump the card's `data-updated`, set
   `data-upgraded="true"`, and refresh the blurb if the scope changed.
5. **Verify** — open the file in a browser (or headless with a console listener),
   exercise every widget, run the quiz through to the results slide, press **S**
   for speaker view, and resize to mobile width.
6. **Tick.** Change `- [~]` to `- [x]` and append the PR number, then update the
   progress counter at the top of this file.
7. **Commit, push, open the PR.**

**Do not:** change the brand palette, add build tooling, add new CDN
dependencies, rename deck files, or edit another agent's claimed decks.

## 6. Priority order

1. Small-tier decks — the biggest quality gap: Programming, Website Development,
   Mobile Apps, Software Testing, and demos #72–#87.
2. High-traffic Core IT and Cyber Security decks.
3. Emerging Technology and Digital Skills large-tier decks.
4. Special cases last: #142 stub build-out and #143 scroll tutorial.

## 7. Deck checklist

Each entry shows the deck number, file, current tier and slide count, the target
slide count, and suggested widgets. Widget suggestions are a starting point, not
a mandate — swap them if something fits the topic better.
